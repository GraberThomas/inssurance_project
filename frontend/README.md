# Frontend Application

## Overview
This project is the frontend component of a larger microservices architecture. It's built with React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap, providing a modern and responsive user interface for insurance cost prediction and management.

## Key Features

### 1. Insurance Cost Prediction
- Multi-step form for gathering client information
- Input validation and error handling
- Real-time prediction using machine learning models
- Customizable prediction parameters:
  - Personal information (name, age, sex)
  - Geographic location
  - Health metrics (BMI)
  - Lifestyle factors (smoking status)
  - Family composition (number of children)
- GDPR-compliant data saving options

### 2. Model Management
- View and select different prediction models
- Compare model performance metrics
  - R-squared (RÂ²) values
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Real-time model switching
- Model performance tracking

### 3. Prediction History
- Comprehensive history tracking
- Advanced filtering capabilities:
  - Model-based filtering
  - Demographic filters
  - Date-based filtering
  - Health metrics filtering
- Detailed prediction records
- Pagination and sorting options
- Export functionality for data analysis

## Dependencies
This frontend application is part of a larger system and requires the following services to function properly:
- `api` service
- `backend_persistence` service

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm
- Docker and Docker Compose (if running with the complete stack)

## Installation

### Local Development Setup
```
bash
